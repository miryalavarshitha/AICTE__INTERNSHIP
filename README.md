# Garbage_classification using Deep Learning
ðŸš€ **Live Demo:** [Garbage Classification App on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/miryalavarshitha/garbageclassification_app)

This project aims to classify images of garbage into six categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built on EfficientNetV2B2. The workflow covers everything from dataset extraction to model deployment.

#WEEK-1

1.**Dataset Extraction:** The dataset (garbage_dataset.zip) is unzipped into the /garbage_dataset directory using Python's zipfile module.

2.**Image Dataset Loading:** The dataset is loaded from /garbage_dataset/archive/TrashType_Image_Dataset using TensorFlowâ€™s image_dataset_from_directory:

  -600 images are found, divided into 6 classes.
  
  -80% (480 images) used for training.
  
  -20% (120 images) initially used as validation.
  
3.**Validation Split for Testing:**
  The original validation set is split into:
  
  -Test Set: First half (60 images)
  
  -Final Validation Set: Second half (60 images)
  
  -The test set is optimized using caching and prefetching for efficient evaluation.
  
4.**Class Names Check:**
    Class names are printed and confirmed to match:
    
    *['cardboard', 'glass', 'metal', 'paper', 'plastic', 'trash']*
    
5.**Visualizing Sample Images:**
  A batch of 12 images from the training dataset is displayed in a 4Ã—3 grid using matplotlib. Each image is labeled with its class name to verify correct labeling    and   loading.

## 5. Visualizing Sample Images:

- Displayed a batch of **12 sample images from the training dataset**.
- Plotted using **matplotlib (4Ã—3 grid)**.
- Each image labeled with its respective class name to verify correct labeling.

---

## 6. Data Preprocessing and Normalization:

- **Pixel Scaling:**  
  All image pixel values normalized from **[0, 255] to [0, 1]**.

- **Data Pipeline Enhancements (for training & validation sets):**
  - **Caching**
  - **Shuffling**
  - **Batching**
  - **Prefetching**

## 7. Model Building â€“ CNN using EfficientNetV2B2:

- Utilized **EfficientNetV2B2** from TensorFlow Keras Applications.

- **Base Model Settings:**
  - `include_top=False` â†’ Removed original classification head.
  - Using **pre-trained weights** for feature extraction.

- **Custom Layers Added:**
  - **GlobalAveragePooling2D**
  - **Dropout (0.2)**
  - **Dense (6 units + softmax activation)** for 6-class garbage classification.

- **Model Summary:**
  - Total Trainable Parameters: Approximately **7 million**

---

## 8. Model Compilation

- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss Function:** Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- **Metrics:** Accuracy

  ```python
  model.compile(
      optimizer='adam',
      loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
      metrics=['accuracy']
  )
  ```

## 9. Model Training

- Train the model on the training set.
- Use the validation set for monitoring overfitting and model selection.

## 10. Model Evaluation

- The model achieves an accuracy of **93%** on the test set.
- Evaluate model performance on the test set using accuracy and loss metrics.
- Optionally, visualize confusion matrix and classification report for detailed analysis.

## 11. Model Deployment

- **Export the model** using TensorFlow's `model.save()` or `tf.saved_model.save`.
- **Deployment Options:**
  - Deploy as a REST API using FastAPI or Flask.
  - Use TensorFlow Lite for mobile/edge deployment.
  - Integrate with web apps via TensorFlow.js.
- **Live App:** [Garbage Classification App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/miryalavarshitha/garbageclassification_app)
